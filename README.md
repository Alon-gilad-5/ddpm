# Homework 2 — Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM)

This repository contains my implementation and analysis of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM).  
The work is presented in a single Jupyter notebook and includes:
- Forward diffusion process visualization
- Reverse sampling procedure
- Loss objectives (ε-prediction formulation)
- Training experiments
- Qualitative results on generated data

## Reproducibility Notes

- If needed, record package versions:
  ```bash
  pip freeze > requirements.txt
  ```
- Ensure random seed is fixed for deterministic sampling comparisons.
- All figures are stored under `images/` and linked directly in this README.
